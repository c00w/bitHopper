Bithopper Coding Style

INDENTS
4 spaces per indent. Don't use tab characters. Don't use 3 spaces.

COMMENTS
Comments are really nice. Docstrings are also nice. We don't have enough of either.

ADDING A NEW FEATURE
I prefer new features be added as new files and modules. If they can't reasonably be done like that or fit within a current module use that. If in doubt ask.

WHY DOES POOL.PY DO EVERYTHING?
Because I haven't had time to split it and clean it up.
