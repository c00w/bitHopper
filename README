# Ubuntu installation

In order to run bitHopper you need to install greenlet module over Python 2.7+ (lookup your allready
installed version of Python with "python -V"):

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools
sudo easy_install greenlet

Tested and woking for Ubuntu 11.04, 10.10 and 10.04 LTS


# Instructions for Windows users

ActiveState Python(recommended, use 32 bit even when you have 64 bit system, it will still work)
http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases/2.7.2.5/ActivePython-2.7.2.5-win32-x86.msi

Greenlet
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet

Although you can download greenlet from the original web site and compile the source manually this is
known to cause issues for lot of users. It is much easier to install greenlet automatically using Python
package manager that comes with ActiveState Python.

To do this you have to click:

Start -> All Programs -> ActiveState ActivePython 2.7(32-bit) -> Python Package Manager

Console will open up and to this console you have to type:

pypm install greenlet

After pypm has finished installing greenlet successully type "exit" and your bitHopper is all set. Although
using ActiveState Python's pypm should work 99% of the time there have been reports of people having issues
with using it. If this is the case you could also download greenlet package from:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Please be aware that these are unofficial Windows binaries for Python. It is always best to either download
greenlet source yourself and compile it or use pypm method. If you have no other way and you have to use
these unofficial binaries then greenlet-0.3.1.win32-py2.7.exe is the correct one to download. It will
extract itself into correct directory.


# Configuring user settings

BitHopper Stats page: http://localhost:8337/stats

Copy "user.cfg.default" to a new file called "user.cfg" then modify the new file to include your pool 
worker usernames and passwords. Run "python bitHopper.py" in *nix or in Windows you can double click on
run-bithopper.bat. After script updates info check if new pools have been added correctly to stats page.

If any of the pools turns red or there is something else missing then edit your "user.cfg" accordingly.

If you don't want to use a pool delete it from "user.cfg" or go to Stats page and switch its role to
disable. BitHopper listens on loopback interface so you should direct your miner to localhost:8337
with any username and password (not blank).


# Switches

You can launch bitHopper with the following parameters:

	--ip                  = IP to listen on
	--port                = Port to listen on
	--auth                = Ask for user and password on stats page (--auth user,pass)
	--listschedulers      = List alternate schedulers available
	--scheduler           = Select an alternate scheduler
	--threshold           = Override difficulty threshold (default 0.43)
	--p2pLP               = Starts up an IRC bot to validate LP based hopping
	--OldConnectionSystem = Uses the old connection system. May help with lots of miners
	--debug               = Extra error output. Basically print all caught errors
	--trace               = Extra debugging output


# Available Schedulers:

   OldDefaultScheduler

A none slicing scheduler. May actually be the best scheduler there is.

   DefaultScheduler

The time based default scheduler. All that matters is time and it tries to be completely fair across all
pools. A little less effective but thoroughly debugged.

   AltSliceScheduler

Tries to be more aggressive at switching pools when thresholds are met rather than finishing a slice. Can be
used with --altslicesize=xxx --altminslicesize=xxx (where you replace x with a number for slice size and min).
Also slice size can be used with --altslicejitter=xx which adds some random variance to slice size. There can
be issues with failing to re-slice often enough.

Specific parameters:

	--altslicesize            = Override Default AltSliceScheduler Slice Size of 900
	--altminslicesize         = Override Default Minimum Pool Slice Size of 60 (AltSliceScheduler only)
	--altslicejitter          = Add some random variance to slice size, disabled by default (AltSliceScheduler only)
	--altsliceroundtimebias   = Bias slicing slightly by round time duration with respect to round time target (default false)
	--altsliceroundtimetarget = Round time target based on GHash/s (default 1000 Ghash/s)
	--altsliceroundtimemagic  = Round time magic number, increase to bias towards round time over shares


   RoundTimeScheduler

Not currently in use.

   RoundTimeDynamicPenaltyScheduler

Not currently in use.


# Skins

You can change the color scheme on the status page. Skins and .jpg preview are located in the StatSkin sub directory.
Just copy the index file to the main directory to change skin and hit refresh on your browser. No need to restart.
