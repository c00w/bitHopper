# Instructions

In order to run bithopper you need eventlet and pyopenssl installed with Python 2.7 (recommended):

http://python.org/download/
https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+download
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eventlet/
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/WebOb/1.1rc1

Copy "user.cfg.default" to a new file called "user.cfg" then modify the new
file to include your pool worker usernames and passwords, instead of mine.
Run "python bitHopper.py". After script updates info, please check if new pools
have been added correctly if not edit your "user.cfg" accordingly.

If you don't want to use a pool delete it from user.cfg or go to http://localhost:8337/stats and switch its role to disable.
BitHopper listens on loopback interface so you should direct your miner to
localhost:8337 with any username and password (not blank).

BitHopper status page: http://localhost:8337/stats

# Windows installation

Download and install:
http://python.org/download/
https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+download
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/eventlet/
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/WebOb/1.1rc1

# Ubuntu installation
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install python-eventlet
sudo apt-get install python-openssl
sudo apt-get install webob
If this doesn't work:
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install webob

Then follow the above instructions

# Switches

You can launch bH with the following parameters:

	--ip                  = IP to listen on
	--port                = Port to listen on
	--auth                = Ask for user and password on stats page (--auth user,pass)
	--listschedulers      = List alternate schedulers available
	--scheduler           = Select an alternate scheduler
	--threshold           = Override difficulty threshold (default 0.43)
	--p2pLP               = Starts up an IRC bot to validate LP based hopping
	--OldConnectionSystem = Uses the old connection system. May help with lots of miners
    --debug               = Extra error output. Basically print all caught errors
	--trace               = Extra debugging output

# Available Schedulers:

   OldDefaultScheduler

A none slicing scheduler. May actually be the best scheduler there is.

   DefaultScheduler

The time based default scheduler. All that matters is time and it tries to be completely fair across all pools. A little less effective but thoroughly debugged.

   AltSliceScheduler

Tries to be more aggressive at switching pools when thresholds are met rather than finishing a slice. Can be used with --altslicesize=xxx --altminslicesize=xxx (where you replace x with a number for slice size and min). Also slice size can be used with --altslicejitter=xx which adds some random variance to slice size. There can be issues with failing to re-slice often enough.

Specific parameters:

	--altslicesize            = Override Default AltSliceScheduler Slice Size of 900
	--altminslicesize         = Override Default Minimum Pool Slice Size of 60 (AltSliceScheduler only)
	--altslicejitter          = Add some random variance to slice size, disabled by default (AltSliceScheduler only)
	--altsliceroundtimebias   = Bias slicing slightly by round time duration with respect to round time target (default false)
	--altsliceroundtimetarget = Round time target based on GHash/s (default 1000 Ghash/s)
	--altsliceroundtimemagic  = Round time magic number, increase to bias towards round time over shares


   RoundTimeScheduler

Not currently in use.

   RoundTimeDynamicPenaltyScheduler

Not currently in use.


# Skins

You can change the color scheme on the status page. Skins and .jpg preview are located in the StatSkin sub directory.
Just copy the index file to the main directory to change skin and hit refresh on your browser. No need to restart.
