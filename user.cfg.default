# Valid pool roles are:
#
# mine = mines on this pool as usual (diff.*0.43)
# mine_c = mines score pools based on this simple formula
#          (n/shares per unit time)/c ∝ (n/hashrate)/c = n/(hashrate*c)
# mine_slush = mine_c with c: 300
# mine_lp = monitor and makes educated guess mining
#   without using the api
# mine_lp_force = mine untill lp is triggered and then resets
#   back to previous role (don't use as default role for pool set-up)
# mine_nmc = setup pool for NMC mining
# mine_ixc = ixcoins pool and diff.
# mine_i0c = i0coins pool and diff.
# mine_scc = solidcoin pool and diff.
# mine_force = ignores active scheduler and mines only this pool
#   (don't use as default role for pool set-up)
# backup = point bH this pool has a good payout system that can use to
#   maintain achieved efficiency (see bh.cfg for more backup options)
# mine_charity = usually mines the pool when they hit
#   and increased diff block (bad luck) + normal mining
# info = shows share count for this pool on stat page
# disable = disables pool completely (you can delete 
#   pool's entry in this cfg file too)
#
# 
# Pool set-up:
#
#  role:          tell bH what kind of mining is wanted at
#                 this pool, pick a valid one from the list above
#  penalty:       floating point number, # of shares will be
#                 multiplied by this number when calculating
#                 shares against difficulty
#                 BACKUP SERVERS: Set it to the percent the server takes. 
#                 The penalty/100 is added to the reject rate when calculating 
#                 which server to use
#  lp_penalty:    normalize LP's of this pool with "x" seconds (greater for fast
#                 LP response pools)
#  percent:       keep submitting shares to pool, % value from you total output
#                 (1% = 1 share every 100)
#  c:             this variable is used together with "mine_c" role and
#                 determines how long it takes shares to decay in value on
#                 score pools (more info on page 200, bH thread in main forum)
#  refresh_limit: pool's api refreshing interval in seconds
#  user_agent:    HTTP User-Agent header to set when retrieving pool stats
#                 Overrides the default in bh.cfg
#  user:          worker username you setup for this pool, u can use {}
#                 to have bH mine different worker accounts ex. user_{bHworker}
#  pass:          password you have for the worker (not needed for all pools),
#                 use {} for password too, ex. password_{bHworkerpass}
#  wallet:        only for Payouts plugin, use a different address for each pool
